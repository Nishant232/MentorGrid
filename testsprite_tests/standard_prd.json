  "user_flow_summary": [
    "A mentee lands on the platform, browses or searches mentors filtering by categories, rating, price, or availability, and views detailed profiles.",
    "The mentee selects a suitable time slot according to their timezone, submits booking details, chooses a payment method, and confirms the session, receiving calendar invites and confirmation notifications.",
    "Mentors set their weekly availability template, add exceptions, sync external calendars, and manage incoming booking requests, accepting or declining as appropriate.",
    "Both mentee and mentor join a secure video session room with integrated controls for mic, camera, screen sharing, and chat, with session notes saved during the call.",
    "Post-session, mentees provide ratings and feedback, optionally making comments public, which contributes to the mentor’s reputation and leaderboard standings.",
    "Admins monitor and manage users through their dedicated admin panel, handling approvals, payments, refunds, viewing analytics, and exporting reports for operational oversight."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "A mentee must be able to perform end-to-end mentor search, slot selection, payment, and booking confirmation within 5 minutes.",
    "Mentors’ availability rules and external calendar sync must prevent double bookings and accurately block busy periods.",
    "Video sessions must reliably connect both parties with functional controls and save session notes.",
    "Feedback submissions must be correctly stored, optionally public, and reflected in mentor reputations and leaderboards.",
    "The admin panel must support user management actions, mentor approvals, payment/refund processing, and display updated analytics within 24 hours.",
    "Critical product funnels (mentee booking, mentor activation, session completion) must be instrumented and track conversion rates accurately with no significant delays.",
    "System must comply with security, privacy, and accessibility standards including RBAC, PII protection, GDPR basics, and WCAG 2.1 AA.",
    "Error boundaries and UI components must handle failures gracefully without compromising user experience."
